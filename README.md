# op-enclave

`op-enclave` is a relatively small modification to the [op-stack](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/)
that proves state transitions in a AWS Nitro Enclave, and submits the resulting state roots to the L1 chain.
This removes the need for the 7-day challenge period, and allows for immediate withdrawals.

## Running a testnet

1. Deploy the Nitro certificate manager using `make deploy-cert-manager`:
```bash
IMPL_SALT=0 DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY=<privatekey> RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org make deploy-cert-manager
```

2. Deploy the system contracts using `make deploy`:
```bash
IMPL_SALT=0 DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY=<privatekey> DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH=deploy-config/example.json RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org make deploy
```

3. Generate a testnet genesis block and deploy the proxy contracts for a new chain using `make testnet`:
```bash
DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY=<privatekey> L1_URL=https://sepolia.base.org make testnet
```

4. Copy `testnet/.env.example` to `testnet/.env` and fill in the environment variables,
in particular the `# per deploy` section at the top.

5. Run the testnet:
```bash
docker-compose -f testnet/docker-compose.yml up
```
